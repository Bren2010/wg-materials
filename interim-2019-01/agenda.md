# Add-in-Place (Barnes)

# Efficiency of the core protocol (Robert, Barnes)

Discussion started in Bangkok, but we should try to either advance it or close it out.  *Might* be possible to make things work with log state.

# Simplifying the key schedule?  (Omara)

Including the GroupState in the key schedule is probably more maximal than we need to be.  Discuss alternatives.

# User-initiated Add (Barnes)

Look at what it would take to solve this and decide whether we want to solve it.

# Federation considerations (Omara)

Determine scope and dispatch to existing docs / new docs.

# ACK / NACK / State management / Re-init (Millican)

In early discussions, there were requests for features of this character:

- Are ACKs / NACKs signed / encrypted / MAC'ed?
- How does an endpoint figure out if it has lost sync?
- How does an endpoint recover from desync?
