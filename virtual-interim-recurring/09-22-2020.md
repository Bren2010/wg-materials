# Issues/PRs

- #406: External Commits
  - Motivation: Don't want to wait for an existing member to add us to a group.
  - "Send from outside" only works if *one* new member is added.
  - Brendan: Purpose of chaining from previous epoch isn't just accumulating entropy, it's for PCS.
  - Richard: Might be useful to define a struct that contains the information external joiners need.
  - Richard: HPKE actually has exporter keys, so maybe could use that instead of encrypting something.
  - Richard: Maybe use ExternalJoin proposal instead that defines how new init secret is computed.
  - Brendan: Can we change every Commit to use new mechanism that's friendly to external joiners? If the external-friendly mechanism is really just as secure, we should always use it.
  - Richard: Need to think.
  - **Changes requested:** Switch to "KEM to group" strategy and define group.

- #404: Remove long term and explicitly prevent changing of identity
  - **Good to merge.**

- #401: Derive handshake keys from a secret tree as well.
  - Simplifies code implementation.
  - Konrad: You have to keep around a lot more keys.
  - **Changes requested:** Split the key schedule at secret tree leaf.

- **Action Item:** Schedule two more interims for 6th and 20th of Oct.
