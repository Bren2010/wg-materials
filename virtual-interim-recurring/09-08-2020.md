# Issues/PRs

* PR #336 
    * ReInit as Proposal makes sense, just require that it be the last proposal in the Commit
    * Also have Replace with Welcome / H(Welcome)?
* PR #337 - Hold pending #336
* PR #360 - RLB and Brendan working out details, will merge when ready
* PR #349
    * Anonymous version could make ordering requirements difficult for server / require more state
    * Anonymous version could complicate fork detection; since messages in the two forks will have different epochIDs, they wonâ€™t be obviously colliding
    * Whichever we do (current or anonymous), the other one can be built over the top:
        * Anonymous->not: Leak extra information, e.g., in AAD
        * Not->Anonymous: Strip/replace groupID+epoch in MLSCiphertext on send, reconstitute on receive
    * For now: Keep anonymous thing, make bigger, add operational considerations (server vis, fork detection => leak in AAD)
