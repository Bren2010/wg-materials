# Issues/PRs

PSKs: Not sure all the use cases make sense. Some feel recover is too heavy weight.  Branch might not be a the top.  But, if the mechanism supports all maybe it’s okay.

Don’t want to burden everyone.


## PSK And Their Use: Britta and Konnrad

Richard: Could also address the following issue at the same time:\
https://github.com/mlswg/mls-protocol/issues/325

Britta - or we keep 'em seperate

325-327 would be address next meeting - key schedule


## 301 - Targeted Messages Raphael

This might overlap with the branching case….
