The meeting was scheduled to discuss key schedule-related issues and pull requests. Unfortunately, there were some scheduling issues and the meeting pivoted to discuss recent proposals from Joel:
1. [Somewhat better PCFS for cheap](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/mls/dUl3X_gjwiOt7_oOvBw2JaGM4D4/)
2. [Hardening MLS against bad randomness](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/mls/ZR84smU5xeLrziNTk5W1P1Z1nQI/)
