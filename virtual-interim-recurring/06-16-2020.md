# Issues/PRs

Authors sent to the mailing list a list of issue that they propose closing

- #336 still just awaiting RLB review

- #342 ready to merge

- #345 to be closed and folded into #348

- #347 to be closed until we come up with a more complete story for operating with partial tree state.

- #348 
* Needs to fold in #345
* Needs an ID for the extension
* Maybe note that this could interact poorly with encrypted handshake messages

- #302
* Britta notes that allowing the adversary to select keys is a different proposition from affecting nonces
* Might make security analysis much more difficult
* Deprioritize for now, but keep open

- #142
* This protects some metadata, but will often need to get unwound for engineering reasons
* RLB will make a PR and we can come to closure around that
